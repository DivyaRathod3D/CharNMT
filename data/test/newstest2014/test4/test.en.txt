A black box in your car?
As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.
The tea party is aghast.
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.
They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.
This really is a must for our nation.
"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more miles to the gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.
Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.
"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.
"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.
Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.
California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.
"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People are paying more directly into what they are getting.
The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.
The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is looking into one.
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It was not something people wanted.
As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.
Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.
Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.
According to the police his death was due to drowning.
However, the police have taken the friend of the deceased into custody for hiding the deceased's luggage at his house.
The police have filed the final investigation report with the court.
It may be recalled that on August 26th the police recovered the body of Jahid Iqbal from the Jhelum river in Padshahi Park.
His family had accused his friends because his mobile and other luggage was missing.
The police said in their report that the deceased's phone and SIM card were checked and his phone was being used by a woman named Saura.
After questioning the woman, she said that the phone had been given to her by a relative named Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Park and was a friend of the deceased.
On August 25th, after Namaaz-e-Jumma, Ruhail had gone with Jahid to bathe in the Jhelum river.
Jahid took off his clothes and left all his things on the banks, while Ruhail went to the other bank to smoke a cigarette.
When he returned Jahid was not there, only his clothes were there.
Ruhail looked for Jahid, but he could not find him.
Then he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other things and kept them for his own use.
He did not tell anyone that Jahid has drowned.
The police told the court that Jahid has drowned and the post-mortem report confirmed this.
However, Ruhail was arrested under section 404 for hiding the facts and possessions of the deceased.

The 77 year old former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, known for his Bunga Bunga parties, has married a 28 year old girl in an extremely secretive manner.
This was revealed by a family friend, Marythell Polanco.
According to her, the three times Prime Minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascale in his private chapel.
Francisca met Berlusconi when she was a teenage activist with the Forza Italia Party.
This is the same Francisca, about whom it has been said that her relationship with Berlusconi is a sham.
Berlusconi's close friend and the Bunga Bunga Girl Marythell Polanco revealed that she was also invited to this secret wedding.
This ceremony took place three weeks ago.
During the revelation on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if those two were to get married, Polanco replied that they are already married.
This was not a public ceremony.
This wedding was held in the chapel at the former Prime Minister's home.
Other than this, no one can say anything more.
However, she did not go to the wedding.
She had sent her best wishes to the newlyweds.
They got married about three weeks ago on October 8th or 9th.
He got engaged about 8 months ago to the 28 year old woman, Francesca Pascale, who is 50 years younger than him.
To avoid embarrassment, Berlusconi claimed loneliness as the reason for his decision to marry.
Between the hide and seek with the sun, rain continued in low-lying areas.
This created a cold front in the valley.
The cold could be gauged by the fact that the minimum temperature at Shrinagar was 4.8 degrees Celsius, in Gulmarg it was below 0 at -0.2 degrees and in Leh it reached -1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coolest place in the whole state.
However, due to rain and snow the strategically important Srinagar to Leh national highway has been closed to traffic.
There is heavy snowfall in the Jozilla Pass.
This is the fourth snowfall of the season in the Kashmir valley and the first heavy snowfall.
Due to the western disturbance activity, since the early hours of Thursday the higher hilly regions have experienced some snowfall and the low lying areas had rainfall, that continued until late into the evening.
Normal life has also been affected by the cold.
People remained in their homes to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, the electricity supply has also failed in this area.
The day temperatures in Shrinagar were four degrees below normal and were recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius.
Due to the rains along with strong winds in Jammu in the early morning of Thursday, the cold increased at night.
A minimum temperature of 16.6 and a maximum temperature of 27.0 degrees Celsius were recorded in Jammu.
According to the weather department, the influence of the western disturbances is declining and the weather will improve by Friday.
According to the Shrinagar weather department's Director, Sonam Lots, the weather in the valley from November the first to the seventh is expected to be dry.
Asaram, jailed on sexual assault charges, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
It was pleaded on behalf of Asaram that the media coverage is presenting him as a kind of Dracula drinking the blood of children, but the Supreme Court denied his request to ban the media coverage.
Chief Judge P. Satshivam's panel refused to ban the media coverage about Asaram and said that they had read every word reported by the media and had not found anything objectionable in it.
When they are receiving information from the police and other people how can we stop them?
Before that Asaram's lawyers accused the media of showing highly biased news.
The country has so many newspapers and news channels.
They cannot file cases against every one of them, but the panel was not influenced by this plea and refused to file a complaint, saying that they had other options too.
The Court has already previously denied Asaram's request to ban the media coverage.
The officers of the department claim that this is the biggest case of TDS theft to date.
The director of the Mall group made payments to all the financial institutions after deducting the TDS, but did not deposit it in the government treasury.
In this way he kept the accumulated TDS amount.
The Mumbai Income Tax team, along with the team from the Jaipur Income tax department, raided this group on October 17th.
During the investigation of this group it was revealed that this businessman had deducted the TDS but had not paid it in.
This is why the TDS team initiated an income tax survey of this group.
About 15 days before, raids and a survey was carried out on the mall's group of directors, before there was any risk of the accounts being sealed.
Angry with these actions, the businessman clearly told the officers of the income tax department that he is not ready to pay the TDS amount due to the income tax department right now.
The Income tax department is continuing to target him and take action.
In this case the officers have explained that if payment is not made the accounts will be frozen and a recovery procedure will be initiated.
As Diwali is approaching the demand for desserts has increased.
Because of this, the sale of substandard and counterfeit milk solids has increased.
To make the desserts glossy, colourful and sweet, chemicals that are harmful for the health are being used,.
The Food and Drug Administration Department has launched a campaign against fake milk solids and chemical based desserts.
The department has seized Rs.70 thousand worth of milk solids brought in from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5 thousand worth chum chum from the Quetta Colony.
With the increase in demand of desserts in the market the demand for fake milk solids from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received a tip off that substandard milk solids were being brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur and stored in soil.
The milk solids were brought from the transport garage to Nagpur.
The milk solids seized by the department were reported to be worth Rs.70 thousand.
No one has claimed the milk solids due to the risk of legal action.
The department has destroyed the same as it was considered unclaimed (unknown).
The department raided Jitendra Caterers in the Quetta Colony and seized chum chum worth around Rs.5 thousand.
A chemical named sodium hydro-sulphate is used to make the chum chum shiny and more lasting.
A sample has been sent to the laboratory.
The joint-commissioner of the department, S.S. Deshmukh, said that the campaign to seize chemical based desserts and substandard or counterfeit milk solids will continue.
The department also said that in the next few days this campaign would intensify.
The consumption of these desserts can cause poisoning.
The department has asked tradesmen to use good milk and milk solids when making desserts.
An appeal has been made on behalf of the department to the public to beware of fake desserts.
42 selected senior leaders of the state BJP unit gave him a grand reception at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi was here on a consolation tour in Bihar organised by the BJP.
The consolation tour was an exercise organised by the BJP to console the families of the victims of the Patna bomb blasts.
It is noteworthy that a total of 7 bomb blasts occurred one after the other during Narendra Modi's Hunkaar rally on October 27th.
Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the bombings had intended to cause a stampede during the rally, so that more people would die and to spread panic in the state.
The terrorists intentions were thwarted but six people died in the blasts.
They all have been declared to be martyrs by the BJP.
An urn tour was organized from their village by the party leaders on Thursday.
Their remains were buried in the Ganges in Patna on November 5th.
The consolation tour was a part of this tour.
The main player in this was Narendra Modi.
He will be going to the villages of the people killed in the bomb blasts to meet the families.
During this meeting and visit he will be donating cheques worth five lakh rupees to each family of the deceased.
This financial aid has been already announced by the BJP.
When the exciting Indian team plays at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium after their spectacular win in the last match for the seventh and last one-day against Australia, they will be aiming to win this match and win the series.
After rains washed out the last two one-day matches, they had to win the Nagpur one-day for India to remain in the series, and its batsmen played an amazing game and had a record win, levelling the series at 2-2.
In this series team India has achieved the target of 350 or more runs twice and once again the responsibility to save the team lies with the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak now and even the bigger targets seem small to them.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohile and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team also has high expectations of Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the opening pair of Rohit and Shikhar is making the job easier for the other batsmen, with their strong partnership.
They gave Virat the opportunity to bat without any pressure in Jaipur and Nagpur with their remarkable opening partnership.
Given the great performance by Virat up until now at No.3, he is being seen as the future Sachin Tendulkar.
Actually, a lot of cricket greats have said that he is better than Sachin.
Virat, who is completing 25 years next week, has scored 17 one-day centuries out of which 16 have lead to an Indian victory.
While chasing a target his average is above 80 and he has emerged as a excellent finisher.
The top three batmen of India are in great form, but too much reliance on these three can also be damaging for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were very bog flops in the last match.
Yuvraj could not even open his account in the two matches of the series.
Because of this, a good innings at the Bengaluru one-day would be a 'lifeline' for him.
As far as Australia team is concerned, their batsmen especially Captain George Bailey, has impressed everyone with his performances.
There has been demand to include him in the Home Ashes test team against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides of Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
Although Phil Hugh and Eron Finch haven't been able to make an impression at the opening.
However, the absence of bowler Michael Johnson could make things difficult.
Johnson, who had been performing well until now in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson, Dr Jitendra Singh, said Pakistan is now working on a new strategy to infiltration of terrorist groups under the guise of peace.
Citing reports from intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued on Thursday that Pakistan is leaving no stone unturned in trying to infiltrate 2,000 terrorists trained in their training camps.
That is why they will never allow peace to prevail on the border.
After the separatists intentions of provoking the people in Kashmir and spreading widespread unrest failed, Pakistan has become more unruly.
Citing the Pakistan tour of the separatist the BJP leader said that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb chief's Hafeez Sayeed and Saiyad Sallahuddin have predicted a rise in terrorism in 2014.
Pakistan is seriously trying to complete this promise.
The killing of soldiers on the border and suicide bombings in Samba, Hiranagar are part of the same strategy.
While stating that under these circumstances demand for the suspension of the special rights of the army would be dangerous, he said that saying such things before things cool down in the state is also not in the public interest.
This would abet the anti-national elements.
He stressed that the leaders should stop making statements that reduce the morale of the army and security forces.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.
However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.
O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.
That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.
"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.
It will still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.
In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.
NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The issue will be resolved this evening.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.
Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.
Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A wonderful performance was given at the show "Ek aur Dronacharya" showing the resemblance between the Dwaapar yug and today.
It showed how, in today's world, a teacher can be forced to follow the wrong path in compromising circumstances.
The play was inaugurated in the St. Joseph Inter College auditorium jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhdayal Valmiki, Cantonment Board Vice-president Shipra Rastogi, Nresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play showed the similarities between the conditions in Dronacharya in the Dwaapaar age and followed a professor called Arvind in the present day.
The play directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goel, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Ghazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. did full justice to the characters and was a spectacular show.
The theatre lighting was handled by a young artist, Jitendra C. Raj, and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this function on behalf of APTA, many awards were presented to various literary and cultural personalities.
The head of the Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Senior Journalist Shambhunath Shukla and theatre designer Jitendra C. Raj were awarded on this occasion.
Among the officials of the executive committee, secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc., contributed to the success of the program.
Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.
After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.
"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.
But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.
There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.
Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.
That will happen all through the flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.
Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.
The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.
Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.
New research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning hours.
Thoughts of lying to anyone and theft or cheating someone do not enter our heads.
But as the evening comes, our minds change and we set aside our principles and we go against the accepted norms.
In research carried out by Harvard University and the David Axle School of Business, Utah, researchers have revealed some interesting facts.
According to researchers, while we don't have work pressure in the morning we attach importance to moral values, but as the evening sets in, due to fatigue or extra pressure our honesty declines.
To test this researchers did two experiments.
They asked some subjects to count the number of dots on a computer screen.
For example, subjects had to say if the dots were more on the right or left-hand side.
Participants were then told that if they give the wrong answer rather than the correct answer they would be given money.
This experiment shows that those who took part in the experiment in the morning between 8 and 12 did not make any mistakes and they gave the correct answers.
At the same time, those who took part in the experiment between 12 noon and 6pm set aside their morals and intentionally gave wrong answers.
Researchers have succeeded in proving that in the morning the greed for money does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we chose to ignore morality.
The research is published in the current issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the robbers left waving pistols.
Relatives admitted the wounded to the hospital in a critical condition.
Sunder s/o Sohanveer, a resident of Madhi Village, had recently retired from the post of junior engineer from the Electrical Department.
On Wednesday he was returning home on his bicycle after withdrawing 44 thousand rupees from the Bhola branch of the Syndicate Bank.
On the Bhola to Marhi road, two men riding a bike came from behind and robbed Sundar and took the 44 thousand in cash.
When Sunder protested they shot him in the stomach, wounding him.
Upon hearing the news, family members and villagers rushed him to the hospital in Meerut in a serious condition.
No report was filed until the news was reported.
Note that three days ago Jasveer, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot and injured while returning home from the same bank by two robbers.
The police could not reveal any information about many more similar recent cases besides these.
S/o Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the details of the incident would be revealed soon.
When the hotel employees protested the fight began.
R.K. Singh, the hotel owner's younger brother came to mediate, the MP's drunken son started a scuffle with him.
In the meantime, a lot of people gathered there.
When an attempt was made to grab the assaulting youth he fired the revolver.
The shooting triggered panic in the area.
After this the hotel employees caught him and informed the police.
The hotel owner, Munna Singh, on reaching the police station filed a report against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Barecha Pahadpur at the Koirana station in the Bhadohi district.
Upon which the police arrested Anand and seized his revolver.
According to Handiya Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Pratapgarh in Khabhor, runs a hotel called Raag Durbar on the National Highway.
At around 8pm Anand Pandey arrived at the hotel and ordered food.
When the service was delayed, he started shouting abuse, assaulting the staff and shooting.
Anand was drunk and he also threatened to kill the hotel employees.
The inspector said that the Hotel is near Bhiti Village and adjacent to Bhadoi District.
Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed
Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court
A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.
The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed
Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.
Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.
In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.
But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.
He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."
His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.
Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.
On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.
Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."
The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.
Although Nita Ambani, the wife of the world's richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani, celebrates her birthday on November 1st, as the clocks struck twelve on the night of October 30th, the whole of Jaipur began to celebrate Nita Ambani's birthday.
Prior to that, the mood of the occasion had already been set by A.R. Rahman and his group's performance.
A.R. Rahman sang his signature songs in the musical evening that started at 8 p.m.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage to add colour with her dances.
Guests arrived in around 32 chartered aircraft to attend Nita Ambani's birthday party.
As space at Jodhpur Airport was inadequate, the chartered planes landed at Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
same way 135 luxury cars were also used, including BMWs and Jaguars.
Sood said that the city's sanitation system and street lights had totally broken down.
No steps were being taken by the municipal corporation and HUDA to run Panchkula city centre.
He demanded the complete abolition of house tax in Panchkula.
On Friday, while addressing a press conference here, V.K. Sood said that, after the municipal corporation elections the city got a new councillor and mayor, but they do not have the powers necessary to get the work done.
So the city councillors have become dummies and officers are doing as they pleased.
Sood said that the municipal corporation has crores of rupees at its disposal, but all the money is in the form of Bank FDs and interest is being earned on it.
So no steps are being taken to use that money for the development of the city.
V.K. Sood said the refuse dump issue is the most serious problem.
By creating a dump in Sector 23, people living in sectors beyond Ghaggar are forced to live a hellish life.
The municipal corporation officers have been talking about shifting the dump to the village of Jhuriwala for the past several years now, but the inhabitants of the Barwala area are already facing a serious problem with flies.
He said that healthcare and educational facilities are extremely bad.
No work has yet been started to provide facilities for rural inhabitants.
UN hails new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to "rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.
It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life", author says.
Tales of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying many of the myths would be "far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education," he said.
I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He added authors and teachers being "overtly didactic" is a "total switch-off" for children, with messages being "subliminated" in enjoyable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that must be subliminated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The old basis of showing not telling.
Samvaad Associate, Ghumaarvi: the head constable, Om Prakash, retired after serving the Police Department for 32 years in Ghumaarvi.
To celebrate the occasion the employees and officers of the Police Department organised a farewell party.

He served very well throughout his entire tenure.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.
Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.
We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.
This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Oil extends drop toward $96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
Benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Ample supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels.
But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity.
That suggests China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a two-decade low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.
She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.
Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.
The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.
Huge numbers of participants from Godda, Pakuf, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatara districts took part in the training.
All the participants were trained in many disciplines over a period of seven days, including pitching tents and erecting flag poles.
Training is being provided with the co-operation of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Roy and Isha Ghosh.
All the participant helped to spread a sense of unity by taking part in nondenominational prayer sessions.
The Camp Chief and Commissioner of State Training, Vipin Kumar, is offering special assistance.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.
He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.
What about the first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".
Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."
During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."
Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."
But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.
The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.
A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.
Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.
That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.
It has always taken place.
"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.
For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.
The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Nobody is fooled.
Parents of Georgia teen who died in 'freak accident' believe son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead.
My objective is to discovery the truth.
"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died.
CDC issues children's allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.
It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.
Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.
No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.
The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.
New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.
It's like the mystery of why people are gay.
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.
Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.
German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."
One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.
And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.
"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.
When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at age 12.
"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he found out was horrifying.
I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.
Surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."
"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.
We are afraid it will encourage intervention.
We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.
But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.
German law is about assigning it at birth.
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.
When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.
Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'
This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.
We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.
"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.
Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.
It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.
On behalf of the Ramnagar Tehsil Legal Services Committee and under the chairmanship of the committee chairman, Ramnagar Sub-Judge Sandip Kaur, a Legal Awareness Camp was organised at the Middle school, Dalher in Ramnagar.
In this camp awareness was raised about the right to education and information for financially underprivileged people.
Advocate M.L. Gupta, Rohin Bharadwaj and Sarpanch presented their views on the subject and gave lectures to the people in the camp.
A large number of villagers attended the camp.
Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.
According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.
"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.
While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."
The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me around £140.
It tastes pretty good though.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.
The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
Rani Bagh Market was packed with customers.
The situation was such that people had to wait from 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same was the case in Vajirpur, Avantika market, Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar, the Central Market, and the central market in Prashant Vihar.
There was a similar scene in the jewellery shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, and Model Town.
Many people were shopping for gold and silver ornaments and coins.
Because of this, the outer ring road, along with other markets, were jammed with traffic.
Because of this people leaving the office had to spend hours in traffic jams on their way home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.
I haven't signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.
But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.
We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.
That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.
It's a mystery I have yet to solve.
Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."
Finally, let's talk pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.
The MCA said in a statement, "It was decided that the postage stamp with Sachin's photograph on it would be issued prior to the start of the match.
Afterwards, there would be a joint presentation by the BCCI and the MCA.
Besides that, a special coin would be used for the coin toss that would be kept by the MCA.
The MCA will also publish a 64-page brochure, which will have articles about Tendulkar and testimonies about him from the business, sporting and journalist around the world.
The association said the limited edition brochures and coins will be distributed to members of the MCA and the BCCI.
They said that every day 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 caps bearing Sachin's photograph will be distributed.
Land Rover rally series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point harness belts, as well as an intercom system.
Options include upgraded brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistic support, and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, the managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed."
They're not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure, and an achievable path towards world-class events.
We're delighted to be offering this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas, and prepare entrants for the rigours and realities of Rally Raid.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it'll be a really fun championship.
Additionally, the Defender Challenge will provide a training and test day in February, as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The dream of firecracker traders of doing good business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not realised.
The firecracker traders are trapped in a dilemma after the High court's order.
Neither can they do business in the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses to do business in the Transport area.
After its visit to the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue the commission, appointed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, had declared it unsafe.
Since no appropriate arrangements were made there, the Deputy commissioner was fined ten lakh Rupees.
The High Court strongly criticised the Amritsar administration in its order and questioned the use of such an administration that could not even resolve such a small issue as that of the firecracker traders over a period of the 9 years.
No proper place has been allotted to them in the city.
Thereafter, they were asked to provide appropriate and safe facilities and to issue the licenses for selling firecrackers in Jahajgarh market itself.
After this order the firecracker traders were happy but the police poured cold water on their joy on Friday.
The firearm license branch team arrived in the firecracker market and set up a counter selling forms.
The necessary terms and conditions involved, could not possibly be met in one day.
ASP East Gaurav Garg, Firearms License Branch chief, Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanvind Arun Sharma also went to the firecracker market.
They expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
So the licenses were not issued to the firecracker traders.
Diwali is just one day away.
For this reason the firecracker vendors were worried.
The loss of crores of rupees seemed inevitable.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said that if they lost a large amount of money they would sue the district administration.
On Friday night the angry firecracker traders went on a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjeet Avenue.
The shouted slogans against the police and the administration.
Thereafter the business in the temporary firecracker market at Ranjeet Avenue was also stopped.
Fire crews called to rescue lost puppy after she got stuck 50ft above the ground on precarious ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash
She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry
Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death
A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.
Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.
At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.
A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.
She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.
But she is fine now.
She was eating biscuits afterwards.
This was a very unusual call-out.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."
The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying."
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place.
It was amazing to get her back in our arms.
The vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
It was really daring what they did.
We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there."
The firefighters were brilliant.
I just can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that "he hit on me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago, and he's been very kind."
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, says he "categorically denies that he has ever made a pass at Katy Perry."
The rep adds: "Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones' tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice
Another day, another independence scare story.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.
Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.
Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.
So, a non-story, then.
And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?
Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.
Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.
As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.
That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.

This hostility has been codified in an impressively crafted document that was published in early December The Future Vision of Palestinian Arabs in Israel  Issued by the Mossawa Center in Haifa  which is partially funded by American Jews  and endorsed by many establishment figures its extremism may well mark a turning point for Israeli Muslims The paper rejects the Jewish nature of Israel insisting that the country become a binational state in which Palestinian culture and power enjoy complete equality <s> The documents notion of a joint homeland means Jewish and Arab sectors that run their own affairs and have the right of veto over certain of the others decisions Future Vision demands adjustments to the flag and anthem canceling the 1950 Law of Return that automatically grants Israeli citizenship to any Jew and elevating Arabic to be the equal of Hebrew It seeks separate Arab representation in international fora Most profoundly the study would terminate the Zionist achievement of a sovereign Jewish state

The slight change in the angle by the photographer has changed the mood of the photograph.
If you don't believe it, take a look for yourself.
If scrap is stored properly and with proper lighting it can also become a piece of art.
Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in the US spying has gone too far, in some cases.
He also claimed that innocent people have been tortured under secret surveillance programs.

But, in an effort to gain information, in some cases inappropriate methods had been used.
Meanwhile, a key committee of the U.S. Congress has approved a bill to limit the monitoring activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].
The aim of this is to make monitoring more transparent and to get back the trust of the people which has been lost following the disclosure of large scale phone tapping.
This move by the Senate was welcomed by six U.S. companies including Google and Yahoo.
The data centres in these companies have also been hacked by the NSA.
On Friday the select committee of the Senate passed a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act(FISA)by 11 votes to 4.
Many restrictions, including an outright ban on phone tapping, have been proposed in this bill, under the American Patriot Act.
Deliberate, unauthorized collection and use of data under FISA will be treated as a criminal offence and will be punishable by up to ten years in prison.
Once both Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate pass the bill, it will become law.
The Committee Chairman and Senator, Diane Festin, said that the NSA's program of recording phone calls is within the law, and believed it had contributed significantly to the country's security.
However, there should be more transparency.
Not only that, the protection of personal privacy should also be kept in mind.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook, disturbed by the revelation of the NSA's Internet surveillance program, have supported this bill.
In letters written to the senators all these companies have said that the senators' proposal to restrict the NSA's large scale phone tapping is welcomed by them.
It is noteworthy that the documents released by the former CIA employee Edward Snowden made the actions of the NSA public.
The NSA's monitoring of the phone conversations of the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France, had caused a huge uproar in the international community.

Thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet?
Flight Centre seem to be bucking the trend.
The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the $305 million to $315 million it previously forecast.
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $290.4 million profit it achieved in 2011/12.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-business travel.
"Year-to-date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically our largest profit generators.
In Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less.
Its US business had recovered its losses during its seasonally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit.
Flight Centre shares were up 3c at $38.20 yesterday.
In a recent media report it was said that the NSA hacked into the data centres of Yahoo and Google for surveillance.
The Washington Post exposed this based on the documents collected by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA program was called Muscular, and was run together with their British counterpart - GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data passing through the vast network of fibre optic cables laid by Yahoo and Google.
On January 9th, 2013 the Washington Post reported, quoting a top secret document, that more than 18 million documents were stolen within just 3 days from the beginning of the program.
These included email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post the program was run out of the U.S. and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA to access this information.
According to the newspaper it was much easier for the NSA to run the program outside the U.S. because in the U.S. such campaigns must have court orders.
During a press conference in Washington the NSA Chief, General Keith Alexander, denied these allegations saying, "As far as I know, this never happened.
The NSA has always gathered its information only within the framework of the law".
The NSA recently became a target after spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the U.S. government has issued assurances that communications are not being monitored.

Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading;
A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The syllabus will place a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court has refused to ban media reporting.
The Supreme Court said that they cannot ask the media to stop reporting information collected from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram was being made out to be a kind of Dracula in this case.
In this case, the guidelines for reporting are in place but they are not being followed.
The Supreme Court said that there are several other options that could be used.
Asaram's lawyer said that there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels in the country, but specifically there were having problems with two channels.
These people were damaging his image and are guilty of one-sided reporting.
Asaram's rights should be protected in this case.
The Court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that they have other legal options which they may make use of.
Pawan Bansal attcked by the opposition's questions on Rail Gate, shocked the opposition by saying that he had not so much as looked at a women in the past 15 years.
After this everyone one was stunned and wondered where the issue of a woman had come from.
Maybe, Bansal was hinting at the family life of a Senior BJP leader and legislator.
Then, changing the subject, Bansal told the reporters that in the last parliamentary elections the BJP had sent a women after him and conspired to lodge a complaint against him, but that they had failed.
Addressing the reporters Bansal said that the CBI had interrogated him in the Rail Corruption case.
If he has called as a witness then it must only have been after a complete investigation.
Bansal said that, in the booth in question, he had only delivered a letter for a needy person.
If that is a crime, he would always commit the crime.
He said that it was not the corporation's constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, but he himself told the opposition to do so.
He said that as far as the developmental activities were concerned the opposition would be provided with a list of all the developmental activities of the last 15 years.
In Chandigarh they cannot imagine the way in which the development is taking place or will take place.
Greetings were exchanged between the two in a cabinet meeting.
After the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in the meditation camp for the counter attack on Narendra Modi.
He also commented on his speech, saying that he didn't have any second thoughts in his mind.
He wanted the party to become strong.
New challenges will be faced strongly.
The expression on the Chief Minister's face showed that he had taken Singh's speech in a positive way.
It should be noted that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the activists in the meditation camp and to protect them from the alleged harassment by officials.
However, he had also said that to assert his point he was also prepared for the dissolution of the cabinet.
Though, after seeing the opinions arising from the meditation camp there was a chance that the case for putting activists into government posts will also be reconsidered.
At the camp the state JDU president, Vashisht Narayan Singh, had said that the nominations of the activists in the 20-point committee would be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
Now the news is coming that Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, will have a look at the list at his level.
He will also examine whether or not the opinion of the legislators and Members of Parliament was taken into account when generating the list.
If need be the list will be revised on a large scale to give places to older and more committed activists.
The common complaint of the legislators and Members of Parliament is that their opinion was not considered while generating the list.
Most of the people who have come from other parties are on the list but a significant number of workers, active since the Samata Party period, have been left off.
Some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, while others create a perfect life by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One of the such personalities is the late Dhirubhai Ambani.
The third son of Hirachand Govaradhandas Ambani, who worked as a teacher in a school in Coravada, a small village in Gujarat, Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28th, 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third of five brothers and sisters.
The five children were Ramanikalala, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters, Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints Dhirubhai had to drop out after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping in the house financially from childhood.
At that time he set up a stall selling Bhajiyas near Girnar. The income from the stall was dependent on the number of tourists going there.
Dhirubhai's first job was in 1949 at the age of 17 when he arrived on a ship called Cabota in the city of Aden, in the Yemen.
His elder brother, Raniklala, had made all the arrangements for him there, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad.
But Dhirubhai had something else in mind.
So he returned home in 1954.
By 1955, he had landed in Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket, to try his luck.
And from here he started his travel business.
Dhirubhai never looked back.
His name became known not only in the country, but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani bade farewell to the world on July 6th, 2002.
When he died he had Rs 62,000 crores.
Currently his sons, Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, are looking after his empire.
Like their father, today these two brothers are at the international level of businessmen.
Who has not heard of the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, their two sons, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Killing mosquitoes to prevent diseases like dengue, malaria and filariasis is going to be expensive.
The state government is proceeding to raise the tax on mosquito killing repellents, mats and liquids by up to three times.
The proposal to increase tax will be presented to the cabinet soon.
The government is struggling with a financial crisis these days and is searching for ways to do everything possible to increase revenue.
It is noteworthy that, to improve the financial health of the government, a resource committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister, Mohamed Azam Khan.
According to sources, in a recently held resource committee meeting many proposals to increase the tax were rejected if the general public would be directly affected.
However, the committee has given the green flag to increase the taxes on mosquito repellents, coils, mats and liquids.
A proposal to triple the taxes has been put forward.
Currently they carry 4% VAT plus an additional 1% tax.
Now a 12.5% VAT plus a 1.5% additional tax on these items is proposed.
The government is likely to generate additional revenue of around Rs 14 crore in this way.
A proposal for a tax hike on the persimmon leaf was rejected: In fact, to increase the revenue income the commercial tax department was in favour of increasing the tax on the persimmon leaf by 14%, but the Financial Resources Committee has rejected that proposal.
The committee believes that persimmon leaf is used to make bidis that the lower-class people smoke.
Similarly, the committee rejected the proposal to increase taxes on transmission wires, etc., and electrical goods that would have pushed up the cost of electricity and would have a direct impact on the general public.
The committee also rejected the proposal for the application of a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

Jagaran Bureau, Shrinagar: The police have allegedly removed the security of the former Minister Ghulam Hasan Khan who joined Congress from the People Democratic Party.
Khan blamed the government, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It may be recalled that in the year 2002 Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the 2002 elections from Shopian on a PDP ticket, was included in the cabinet, while Mufti Mohamed Sayeed was a Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said he has had protection since 1996.
I live in Shopian, which is believed to be a stronghold of terrorists.
A CRPF security team under the leadership of a sub-inspector is stationed at my house.
I have also bodyguards, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Thursday.
As when the security team was leaving from my house I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District Superintendent.
But instead of restoring security they just said that they would investigate the matter.
However, in this regard, when the Kashmir IGP, Abdul Gani Meer, was contacted he denied any knowledge of the issue and said that it was a sensitive issue.
I should check it out myself. After all, how can the protection of a former minister and senior political leader be removed?
The State Congress Chief, Prof. Safudin Soz, said that as far as he knew  nothing of this kind had ever happened before.
If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised, then it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu now and will be coming to Kashmir in a day or two.
I will discuss this issue with the authorities concerned.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to advertise the anniversary of the birth of Sardar Patel over the last four years.
But, contrary to the claims by Modi during the NDA government (between 1994 and 2004), while Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM there was a time for 2 consecutive years (2001-2002) when not a single advertisement for Sardar Patel was published by the Government.
On Thursday in Kevadia,Gujarat laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high statue, 'the Statue of Unity', Modi said, "Earlier, there was no advertising for the anniversary of Sardar Patel.
While the DAVP's records show that in 2009-10 up to 3 million, in 2010-11 to Rs 4.10 crore, in 2011-12 and Rs 2.7 crore and in 2012-13 to Rs 1.4 crore UPA had been spent on advertising for Sardar Patel.
When the Union Information and Broadcasting Minister, Manish Tewari, was asked about Modi's claims he said that what the BJP's PM candidate said was not based on the facts.
In 2008 the UPA did not publish any ads in the name of Patel.
Tiwari said that it was because of the economic downturn in that year.
The amounts spent on promoting Sardar Patel are far less than the amount spent on the birth and death anniversaries of the Nehru - Gandhi family members.
DAVP has spent 33 crores on the birth and death anniversaries, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and Rs.9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru, on print advertising.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, "it should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on several things, such as the size or frequency of the advertisement for that year.
The fact is that it shows our dedication without understanding that the people opposed to this are busy taking care of the legacy of a great leader.
Today he will meet the families of the people who died in Patna last Sunday.
As it is Narendra Modi's second visit to Patna just a week after the blasts the security has been tightened.
The police have examined the route of Modi's visit and the sites of the meeting thoroughly.
Police will keep an eye on the people coming to the meetings.
The Gujarat police force, the NSGIB and the State police force will take care of security.
Modi's protective shield will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are being raised about the urn procession undertaken by the BJP, carrying the ashes of the people who died in the blasts.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accused the BJP of spoiling the atmosphere.
Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people
Cast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.
That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people can die because they are waiting.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.
And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.
And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
Their luck doesn't always hold out.
They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.
"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.
In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.
With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.
"This will change my future with my family," the man said.
In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.
"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.
The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.
"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.
For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.
Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.

While addressing a rally Modi said, "If you listen to all the speeches given by all the leaders of Congress, then you will see that they never talk about what they have done."
He said, "Congress has become so arrogant that does not answer media questions."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and it is his government, yet they want Modi to respond.
Answering the public's questions is your duty.
Clearly, Modi was referring to Sibal, who had told journalists in Delhi that Modi wants to create an environment where he is in control, where he gives his speeches and he does not talk to journalists in order to avoid their questions.
Sibal challenged Modi to a face to face debate.
Modi said, "I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014, then we will submit a report each year to the public."
Congress has given the tickets to all his former legislators.

The strong contestant of State Vice-President Raipur North Seat, Sachchidanand Upasane, has been appointed Raipur Rural Seat's election Director.
Upasane has been asked to handle the State office and also tour the State if required.
As the State President Ramsevak Paikara and Secretary Shivratan Sharma, along with many other officials, are contesting the elections, Secretary Rampratap is left to handle the organisation alone.
Because of this, Upasane has been handed a great responsibility.
The North seat contestant, RDA President Sunil Soni, has been given the responsible position of the Raipur South Seat election director.
Another contender, Regional Municipal Corporation Chairman Sanjay Srivastava, has been given a seat on the reception committee.
He will receive the party's star campaigner national leaders to help the coming and going.

Obama's Health Care Walk Back
Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."
With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.
"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.
Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.
"You're going to get a better deal," he said.
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.
I am eager to earn your confidence back.
An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.
More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.
It has been revealed that a ransom of two lakh rupees was demanded from the trader.
If no money was paid he was threatened and told his daughter would be kidnapped.
In a case registered in the Hudkeshwar police station efforts to solve the crime are being taken by the cyber cell.
Narendra Bahad (21),a resident of Ayodhya City, is the owner of an electronics shop.
Between the 25th and the 29th he received calls from various numbers on his mobile.
The callers asked for two lakh rupees as ransom.
He was threatened that if the money was not paid Narendra would be killed or his daughter would be kidnapped.
Narendra did not take the threats seriously at first, but when the threats started to increase and his 12th. Std. daughter was threatened he became worried.
The family members are frightened.
A complaint was lodged on Thursday.
No clue to the identity of the criminals has yet been found.
Given the severity of the case support from the cyber crime cell is being sought.
In addition, MLA Bandal has ordered the officials from the villages of Bhagiwander, Bandar Patti, Lalena, Jjal Fulokhari Gatwali and Malkana to meet the people personally and to solve their problems face to face.
The MP has also released grants for rural development.
He ordered the panchayat that the grant released for rural development had to be used properly in order to benefit the village residents.  He took stock of the ongoing paddy procurement arrangements in Bhagiwander village.
He awarded the 15 girls who had received training in sewing with a sewing machine, plants and certificates.
At this time the village of Bhagiwander has 400 congressmen and PPPs, Laleanna has 35 Congressmen and PPPs and the village of Jjal has 71 families following Akali Dal, excluding Congress and PPP members.
Badal said that the farmers in Punjab are being insulted in the markets due to the standards set by the Centre for procurement, while the Centre has always discriminated against the farmers of the Punjab.
Also present with him were DC K.K. Yadav, SSP Ravcharan Singh Barad, ADC D. Sonali Giri, ADC Rajiv Parashar, SDM Shruti Sharma, Talavadi Sabo Area Incharge Balveer Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk along with administrative officers of various departments and Akali leaders.
Due to which the number of cases of violations of the code of conduct are declining.
After the implementation of the election code of conduct between October 4th to October 21st, 313 cases were lodged against various political parties.
While only 31 cases were registered between October 22nd and October 27th.
With the implementation of the election code of conduct cases of its violation were also being reported.
Initially there were many complaints, but gradually they are becoming fewer.
It is being said that, as no-one had full information about the code of conduct, the number of complaints registered against the political parties was rising.
As the election commission made the political parties aware of them and asked them to learn a lesson from the registered complaints the complaints have reduced.
Many parties were campaigning in an old fashioned manner because of a lack of information, but when action was taken against them they stopped doing that.
The political parties are learning about the election code of conduct and are also complying with it.
Due to this the number of cases of code violation have declined.
A proposal concerning this matter has been sent to the government on behalf of ADA, which is soon going to be approved.
This historical city, surrounded on three sides by Ganga-Jamuna has no land left where ADA can plan a big residential project.
So now they have decided to plan residential projects beyond Jhunsi in the east, Fafamau in the north, and beyond Naini in the South.
To make the plan inclusive a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the District collector, Rajshekhar.
ADA has plans to include the villages of Phulpur, Soranva, and Kurchhuna, with a population of two hundred citizens.
After being included in the ADA boundary the Chaka and Bahadur blocks will be completed.
Half of the Kaudihar block will be brought within the ADA boundary.
According to Amarnath Upadhyaya, secretary of ADA, a proposal concerning this matter has been sent to the government.
ADA wants to bring the boundaries of these grampanchayants under its authorisation for planning, and will begin work on it soon.
If that happens, the price of buildings will decline in the city.
The availability of housing for the general public will be increased.
Soon residential palaces on the lines of Lucknow and Noida will begin to be built in these new areas.
In the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32 ENT department head, Prof. Arjun Das of the National Academy of Medical Sciences New Delhi, has been selected for the fellowship.
He has received this fellowship for his remarkable work in the field of ear, nose, throat medicine.
According to the Director of the Institute, Principal Prof. Atul Sachdeva, he is the second faculty member of the institute to have received the fellowship.
The human population has exceeded 7 billion.
If the population continues to increase this way, the time will soon come when mustering a morsel for every hungry mouth would be very difficult.
According to experts, in the near future people will have no other option but to eat worms and insects.
According to reports, this year a group of students from McGill University in Montreal received the Hult Prize for an innovative project.
They were given the award for making protein flour from worms and insects.
A $1 million grant was awarded to them to make it possible for them to pursue their research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30th, the Group Chief Student Researcher, Mohammed Ashor, said that his team will experiment with grasshoppers for food.
This report has an detailed description of edible worms and insects.

Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also a suspect in the case of the rape of a girl in Surat.
Meanwhile, his son Narayan Sai is on the run from the police.
And so now an arrest warrant has been issued for him by the Gujarat police.
From Ahmedabad a report is also coming in that Asaram's trustees are also slowly breaking away from Asaram.
Further action is now also being taken on Asaram's ashrams that have been built illegally or on public land.
We have already informed you that Asaram is the owner of more than 400 Ashrams.
Amongst these is one ashram in New Jersey, USA.
Asaram and his son are accused of various crimes.
In spite of this, the blind faith of some of their devotees continues.
Asaram has a following not only in India, but also equally in America.
Here in India, Asaram is in jail and his devotees are slowly breaking away from him, but this is not at all the case in America.
In the New Jersey ashram even now the devotees continue to come as before and pray to Asaram.
John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.
The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.
I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.
News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.
The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.
He said the itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.
He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.
"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
New politics has begun following the changes in the boards of the Municipal Corporation.
Recently, in the Santhiya Municipal Corporation's Beerbhum District, due to the party change of legislators the Congress led board changed to the Trunamool board.
This change occurred because most of the legislators, including the Chairman of the Municipal Corporation, joined Trunamool.
Not only from Congress, but some of the legislators from CPM, CPI, and Forward Block have also joined Trunamool.
The Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy admits it augurs well for the party.
He said that the Santhiya Municipal Corporation Chairman, Virendra Parikh, and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, along with 10 Congress legislators, have joined Trunamool.
Some legislators from CPM and Left Front have also joined Trunamool.
All of them informed the District Collector in writing, as required by the Bengal Municipal Act, that they have joined Trunamool and because of its majority the Santhiya Municipal Corporation board will come under Trunamool Control.
Mr. Rai also claimed that everyone agrees with the development template decided upon under the leadership of the Chief Minister, Mamta Banerjee.
Political leaders from Congress, the CPM, the CPI, Forward Bloc and other political leaders are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.
Appropriate leaders from any party are welcome to join Trunamool.
The control by Trunamool of the Santhilya Municipal Board due to the change of the party by congress legislators before the November 22nd elections to be held in 5 Municipal Corporations is considered as an important development in the political arena.
Before this the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Congress-ruled Nadia Municipal boards had also come under the control of Trunamool.
When the Municipal boards in the district come under Trunamool party control, due to the change of party, then the new members of the party are made very welcome in Kolkata at the Trunamool Bhavan.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders breaking away from other parties to join the Trinamool party.
He said that leaders breaking away from any party were welcome to join Trunamool.
He claims that the people's trust in Chief Minister Mamata Banarjee's leadership is increasing, and that this is the reason people are joining Trunamool.
The main opposition CPM is claiming that grassroots leaders of the other parties are being threatened and bullied.
People are joining them due to the fear of Trunamool's threats.
The change in the elected local boards is being considered as a blow to democracy by CPM.
It is a right of any party to increase their support base in a democracy but, there are obvious questions  raised by changes of opinion on the accountability of power.
Australian woman appeals Thai jail time
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Implicating Bishnoi, the MP said that eating Curma on one day at the home of a family from a particular community and publishing photos does not make you a supporter of the poor.
They go to various houses and eat Curma three times a day, but never boast about it.
The MP Dipendra Hooda from Rohtak, in a meeting of the Congress activists  from the Maham Halake, said that the rally conducted on November 10th in Gohana was very important for you and us.

Prof. Virendra and MLA Anand Singh Dangi also addressed the meeting.
They handed over a list of 10,000 activists coming to the rally from different villages to the MLA.
Before the meeting the MLA visited the covered shed in the grain market, the second water reservoir in Maham, the National Multi-Technology Institute building, the widening of the Gohana- Lakhanjara - Maham -Bhiwani Road along with the construction site of the Maham four lane road fly-over and ground preparation.
