an excellent way to honor the memory of Angelo Frammartino by having his family join in solidarity with another highprofile victim of Palestinian violence She notes that the Koby Mandell Foundation named for another young man brutally murdered by Palestinian terrorists provides therapeutic camping experiences for terror survivors or the families of those murdered by terrorists Its nonpolitical hosts Jews and nonJews and works on building character Sofer suggests that those who want to honor Frammartinos memory might want to support this camp that works to mitigate the evil brought by those who duped and killed their son
